# A World Fractured

The Golden Order has crumbled, and chaos reigns. Scattered throughout the Lands Between, great warriors seek to restore, or break, the balance of power.

## The Tarnished’s Journey

Guided by the fading light of grace, the Tarnished sets forth. Will you seek the throne, or cast the world into shadow?

```html
---
const fate = 'uncertain'
---

<div>
	<h1>The path before you is {fate}...</h1>
	<!-- Outputs <h1>The path before you is uncertain...</h1> -->
</div>
```

## Echoes of the Erdtree
Once, the Erdtree bathed the world in light. Now, only embers remain, and its roots grow ever darker.

```html
---
const whisper = 'faint'
---

<p>The echoes of the past are {whisper}...</p>
<!-- Outputs <p>The echoes of the past are faint...</p> -->
```

## The Mark of the Tarnished
Those who bear the mark of the Tarnished walk a path riddled with uncertainty. Some embrace their fate, while others curse the gods who abandoned them.

```html
---
const tarnished = true
---

{tarnished && <p>The mark upon you glows dimly...</p>}

{tarnished ? <p>The grace guides you still...</p> : <p>The light fades from your path.</p>}
```

## Relics of a Bygone Age
Weapons of forgotten heroes and lost kings still linger, buried beneath the ruins of old kingdoms.

```html
---
const inscription = '<p>The runes tell of a time before the shattering...</p>'
---

<Fragment set:html={inscription} />
```

## A Lord’s Burden
The throne stands empty, and the realm awaits its new ruler. Will you claim your place as Elden Lord, or bring ruin upon all?

```
